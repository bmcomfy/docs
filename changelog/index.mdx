## ðŸŽ‰ ComfyUI 1.0.0 - Major Milestone Release!

**Enhanced Flux Compatibility**
- Chroma TE now works seamlessly with regular Flux models, expanding your creative possibilities with improved text encoding for better prompt understanding

**Advanced Training Capabilities**
- **LoRA Trainer Node**: Revolutionary in-ComfyUI LoRA training using weight adapter scheme - train custom LoRAs directly within your workflows without external tools
- Streamlined training workflows for personalized model fine-tuning

**Cutting-Edge Model Support**
- **Cosmos Predict2 Integration**: Full support for both text-to-image (2B and 14B parameter models) and image-to-video generation
- Access to state-of-the-art multimodal AI capabilities for comprehensive creative workflows

**Developer & Performance Improvements**
- SQLite database support for better data management and workflow persistence
- Enhanced WebcamCapture node with improved real-time input handling
- Optimized memory management and model loading

**Workflow Impact**
This milestone release significantly expands ComfyUI's capabilities, making it a complete AI creative suite. The addition of native LoRA training means you can now create, train, and deploy custom models entirely within ComfyUI workflows. Cosmos integration brings professional-grade video generation to your toolkit.
